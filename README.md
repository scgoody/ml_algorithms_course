## Highlights

### Final Project
Summarizes the core types of machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised Learning: classification and regression using scikit-learn
- Unsupervised Learning - clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Deep Learning: neural networks with TensorFlow/Keras
Each notebook includes data preprocesing steps, model training and evaluation, and performance metrics and visualizations.

### Homework
Contains supplementary assignments:
- introduction to machine learning principles
- hands-on regression modeling
- presentation on cross-validation & model tuning

### In-Class Notebooks
Include foundational concepts and practical implementations learned in class:
- Supervised Learning: linear regressino, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, etc.
- Unsupervised Learning: k-means, clustering, principal component analysis
- Deep Learning: neural networks uring keras

## Skills Developed
